# Digital Physics Lab: Sine Wave Projection

This repository contains the **Manim** source code for visualizing the relationship between circular motion and sine wave displacement. 

## Visualization
- **Topic:** Trigonometric Projections
- **Language:** Python
- **Library:** Manim (Mathematical Animation Engine)

---

### 🔬 Experiment Overview
In this lab, we map the vertical displacement \( y \) of a rotating vector against the angle \( \theta \) to demonstrate the generation of a sine wave. 

> **Project Status:** This visualization is part of a larger series on digital physics. The full explanation and interactive breakdown will be available in future

## How to Run
To render this animation yourself, you will need the Manim library installed:
`manim -pql your_filename.py SineWaveScene`
