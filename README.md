# Digital Physics Lab: Manim Visualizations 🧪

A collection of mathematical experiments exploring the intersection of geometry and motion. This repository serves as the source code for the "Digital Lab" blog series.

## 🔬 Lab Experiments

### 01. The Pulse of a Circle
An introductory look at the vertical displacement of a rotating vector.
- **Concept:** $y = \sin(\theta)$
- **Key Visual:** Projection of circular motion.

### 02. Sine Amplitude Projection
Demonstrating how the Circle's Radius acts as the "DNA" for Wave Amplitude.
- **Concept:** $y = A \sin(\theta)$
- **Key Visual:** Scaled radius ($R=1.8$) projection.
- **File:** `sine_amplitude_projection.py`
